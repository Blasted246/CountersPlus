# CountersPlus
A combination of widely-used counters, all configurable in one Beat Saber mod.

## Looking For New Maintainers
It's been pretty obvious that, for the past several Beat Saber updates, Counters+ has mostly been on "life support" status. The plugin has recently only been recieving changes necessary for it to function on the newest versions of the game.

To keep it brief, I've run out of any motivation to continue working on Counters+. My focus has been entirely dedicated to other projects (both public and private), and with University starting in late August, my time to dedicate towards Counters+ is only going to decrease.

As such, I am looking for a new maintainer to breathe new life into Counters+. I would like someone who can continue to maintain the plugin for future Beat Saber updates, but also to give the plugin the love and care that it deserves, something I know I won't be able to do myself.

This does not mean I am abandoning the project; Counters+ will still continue to recieve updates for new game versions, however minor issues and feature requests will more than likely be ignored for the forseeable future.

If anyone is interested in picking up the project, please contact me on Discord: `Caeden117#0117`.

## What is this?
**Counters+** (also known as CountersPlus) is a powerful UI Enhancement mod for the popular VR rhythm game Beat Saber. It features a variety of different counters that track varying statistics, all bundled into one core system.

Counters+ also boasts a large amount of configuration, all available from a custom made settings menu.

## Installation
To install Counters+, simply use a Beat Saber mod manager such as [ModAssistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant). This will ensure that any dependencies are installed along with Counters+. If you like to do things manually, download Counters+ from [BeatMods](https://beatmods.com), and drag and drop the containing `Plugins` folder into your Beat Saber directory.

If you want to get access to any potential Hotfix or Prelease/Beta builds Counters+ has to offer, simply watch the repository, and grab the latest release in the [Releases page](https://github.com/Caeden117/CountersPlus/releases).
